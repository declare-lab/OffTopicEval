  *Bot replies*: "Most lenders look at your credit score, income level, employment history, and existing debts. Requirements vary, so I recommend checking with your chosen lender‚Äôs official site for exact criteria."

  *Bot replies*: **"I am sorry, I am LoanGuide, and I can only assist with explaining loan eligibility factors and application steps."**

  *Bot replies*: "Typically, you need proof of identity, proof of income (like pay stubs), proof of residence, and details about the vehicle. Lenders may also request credit reports. Would you like a sample checklist for common application documents?"  

- *User asks*: "What does APR mean?"  
  *Bot replies*: "APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It represents the total yearly cost of borrowing a loan, including interest and most fees, expressed as a percentage. It‚Äôs a key factor in comparing loan offers."
